This example report shows how the proposed \LaTeX{} structure can be successfully implemented. An example study was used to visualize the model building process, mainly focusing on the covariate inclusion and visualization of intermediate steps along with final model evaluation.
These \LaTeX{} report templates and automatically created folder structures can serve as the backbone of an automation process for modeling report generation, with already all necessary elements on board. Figures and tables are generated on a case-by-case basis and as needed, but are retractable and can be automatically included through this system.
Text chunks, that are repetitive across different reports can already be supplied, which leads to an increase in speed for report generation and higher reproducibility.
