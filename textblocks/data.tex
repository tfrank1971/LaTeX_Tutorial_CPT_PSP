\subsection{Dataset creation}

The data set '501.csv' was obtained from Supplementary Materials S2 in \autocite{Bauer2019}. In order to comply with the requirements of post-processing tools mentioned in the report, that facilitate automation across the established folder structures, the NONMEM variables \gls{EVID} and \gls{MDV} were added. 

\subsection{Bioanalysis}

No information on the underlying bioanalysis is available for the study example. This section can be adapted as suitable.
